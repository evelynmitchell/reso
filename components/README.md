# Components!

This section contains a growing collection of reusable elements for other circuits. They are upscaled by 12x, and have accompanying frames showing their execution!

But... You got here kind of early. The two elements, `flipflop` and `flipflop_unheld` are logical flipflops but won't necessarily be useful for you.

There's also `palette.png` which contains all the fourty-eight reserved colors!
